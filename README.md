# Surfs Up Report

## Purpose:
This data analysis is to analyze the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round for W. Avy.  

## Resources
* hawaii.sqlite
* climate_analysis.ipynb
* Python SQL toolkit, pandas, numpy
* Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, Python, Flask

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

* The average temperature in June (at 74.9 degrees Fahrenheit) is 3 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in December (at 71 degrees Fahrenheit).

* June temperatures tends to fall more between low to high 70s degrees Fahrenheit. 

*December Temperatures

* Whereas, December temperatures are not as consistent

## Summary: 
While June data shows a stronger consistency of recorded temperature and December data varied more than June, both months provide appropriate weather conditions for surfing and ice cream. While the average temperature was lower in December compared to June, it was only lower by 3-4 degrees.

* Station USC00519397 has the highest temperatures for both June and December and may serve as the best station to open up a surf and ice cream shop. At the same time, Station UCS00516128, which has the lowest temperatures during both months, only vary by 2-4 degrees. In addition, sometimes Station USC00519397 have recorded temperature lower than Station UCS00516128.  

Note: I thought the homework was missing a lot compared to what the online lessons taught us. Thus, I merged June and December data to compare the statistics, as well as plotted both June and December dataframe to illustrate the data.
